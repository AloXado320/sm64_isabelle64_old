## Info
* Intially made as a tribute for her reveal in Smash Ultimate.
* First version was made using binary edits and other tools.
* Version 1.2 was the first version made in decomp, however 1.3 is not based of it because it's an old repo.

## Installation
Follow the same steps as the readme here:
https://github.com/n64decomp/sm64/blob/master/README.md

But beware that in order to build the rom, you only need to run `make`

It defaults to `VERSION_US` and `F3DZEX` due to changes. No need to change those.
