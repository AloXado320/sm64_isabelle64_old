## Info
* Initially made as a tribute for her reveal in Smash Ultimate (September 2018).
* First versions (1.0 and 1.1) were made using binary edits and other tools.
* Version 1.2 was the first version made in Decomp, however 1.3 is not based of it because it uses an old repo.

## Quick Installation

If is the first time doing this you first need to run these commands:

`make -C tools` then `./extract_assets.py us`

Then after you do the step above, build the rom, running `make` and wait until it's done.

It defaults to `VERSION_US` and `F3DZEX` due to changes. No need to change those or things will break.
